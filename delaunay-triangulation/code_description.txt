Structures

Halfedge, Vertex, TriangleNode

Halfedge
 - 

Vertex
 - copy
 - print

TriangleNode
 - print
 - contains point


Data Structures

DCEL, PointLocation

DCEL
 - print all edges
 - print vertices from a triangle
 - add new vertex
 - create a halfedge between two vertices
 - create a clockwise triangle with 3 halfedges
 - start structure
 - add center vertex inside a triangle
 - check if three vertex are illegal
 - flip and halfedge
 - legallize an edge

PointLocation
 - print nodes
 - set root node
 - search the leaf that contain a point
 - add childs to trianglenode


Delaunay
 - add points
 - compute highest point
